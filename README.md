# 🤖 MevBot Solana - Educational Project

## 🚀 Overview

**MevBot Solana** is a demonstration project designed for educational purposes to explore automated trading concepts on the Solana blockchain. This project provides an interactive, user-friendly interface to simulate interactions with decentralized exchanges like Jupiter, Raydium, and Pump.FUN. It is intended as a learning tool for understanding blockchain programming, trading mechanics, and bot development—not for real-world financial use without thorough testing and validation.

## 🔍 Project Description

MevBot Solana is a simulated trading bot created to help learners understand how automated systems interact with the Solana blockchain. It includes features like:

- **🚫 Scam Token Detection Simulation**: Learn how bots might identify risky tokens.
- **🔗 Network Connection Basics**: Study how blockchain network connections can be automated.

*Note: This is a theoretical tool for education. Do not use it with real funds or in live environments without expert review.*

## ⚙️ Bot Features for Learning

This project showcases configurable settings to demonstrate trading concepts:

- **💰 Stop-Loss and Take-Profit**: Experiment with setting thresholds to simulate profit-taking or loss-limiting strategies.
- **💸 Market Cap Filtering**: Explore how to filter tokens based on market capitalization in a trading simulation.
- **💳 Purchase Amount Options**: Practice defining fixed or percentage-based transaction amounts.

### Example Screenshots for Study:
